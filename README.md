## Description

Built with yarn, node v20, and a lot of vim-motions (yes I use neovim, btw)

Dockerfile and docker-compose is included to build and recommended to test the app easily

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn run start:dev

# spinning up the docker instance
$ docker-compose up -d
```

> [!NOTE]
> Disclaimer: Test is not included in the solution (I know but I was sick and very tired and lazy to write tests, but I do know how to write tests for sure)
